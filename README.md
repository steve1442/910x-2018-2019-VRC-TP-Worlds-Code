# 910x-2018-2019-VRC-TP-Worlds-Code

This was code I wrote for my Highschool Robotics team 910x.

this might not be the most up to date code that is running on the robot. but uh unfortunately I broke the programming port.
on the robot and we donated all our gear to a local highschool. So I cant test to see if it has any issues so yea. I dont recommend downloading this lmao.
